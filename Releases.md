## Notes

- Rotorflight setup instructions can be found on the RF website [www.rotorflight.org](https://www.rotorflight.org/).
- RF 2.1 *is* backward compatible with RF 2.0. You *can* load your configuration dump from RF 2.0 into 2.1.
- If updating from RF1, please setup your helicopter from scratch. Follow the instructions on the website.
- As always, please double check your configuration on the bench before flying!

## Changes from 2.0.0

- Added support for custom CRSF/ELRS telemetry
- Added support for 480x320 (Jumper T15)
- Added automatic profile switching to all *Profile* pages
- Added a *Status* page which
  - Shows the currently active PID and rate profile numbers
  - Shows *Arming Disabled Flags*, if any
  - Shows the amount of free space on a dataflash, if available. It also offers the option to erase the dataflash.
  - Shows Real-time and CPU load
- The *PIDs* and *Rates* pages
  - Now also show the currently active profile
  - You can change and copy the currently active profile
- *Servo* page
  - Changing the center of a servo now automatically sets servo override for the servo being editted
  - Added button *Override All Servos*
- Added *Model on TX* page, with which you can automatically set model name, timers or global variables on your transmitter. Data is stored on the heli, so you can have different timers for your helis while using just one model on the transmitter.
- *Profile - Governor* page: added *Min throttle*
- Added *Experimental* page for firmware testing purposes
- Added page *ESC - FlyRotor*
- Added page *ESC - HW Platinum V5*

- Improved MSP handling and processing
- *Adjustment Teller*: added support for accelerometer adjustments

## Changes from 2.1.0-RC1

- *ESC - FlyRotor* page: added governor support
- *Profile - Governor* page: added *Min throttle*
- Fix: corrected GPS coordinates in custom telemetry script
- Fix: use GV8 on flightmode 8 for storing pilotConfigSet

Rotorflight has a strong presence on the Discord platform - you can join us [here](https://discord.gg/FyfMF4RwSA/).
Discord is the primary location for support, questions and discussions. The developers are all active there,
and so are the manufacturers of RF Flight Controllers. Many pro pilots are also there.
This is a great place to ask for advice or discuss any complicated problems or even new ideas.

There is also a [Rotorflight Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/876445460825093) for hanging out with other Rotorflight pilots.
